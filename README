                      OPEN MICROSCOPY ENVIRONMENT (OME)






    This README file shortly sums up where to find additional information about
	the install, deployment, administration and development of OME.



Building and deploying OME

	The system is being developed and tested on Linux and Mac OS X.  We're
	making use of Apache Web Server, mod_perl and PostgreSQL.  The system is
	being mainly developed in Perl and partially in C.  Several Perl libraries
	and a few C libraries are required.
    
	Additional information can be found in:

	doc/INSTALL
