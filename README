Introduction

    This README file shortly sums up the contents of the Software Build
    and Deployment Document (SBDD) that is located in the OME/doc/SBDD 
    directory. 

    The SBDD describes how to build and deploy the Open Microscopy 
    Environment (OME) software. 

    All the information that is necessary and strictly related to the 
    build and deployment process is unfolded: the mechanism that we use 
    to tag and document software builds, the relationship between SBDD
    and builds, a description of the project repository and its 
    organization, directions on how to retrieve the files needed for a 
    given build as well as how to retrieve the latest developed source 
    code, a list of constraints that your system must satisfy if you 
    want to build and deploy OME, and, of course, detailed build and 
    deployment instructions.




Relationship with SCM

    Software Configuration Management in the OME project makes use of 
    CVS.
    Every time the OME development reaches a state that is noteworthy 
    to the developers and the system is successfully built and deployed, 
    the CVS repository is tagged to freeze that point in time. Also, a 
    Software Build and Deployment Document is written to detail necessary 
    information for the build and deployment process. 

    The information contained in the SBDD only refer to a specific 
    version of the source code and related artifacts in the project 
    repository. That version may not be the same as the latest version in 
    the project repository. Please, read carefully Section I-1 of the SBDD 
    in order to understand the relationship of this document with source 
    code and related build artifacts.




Dependencies

    The system is being developed and tested on Linux and Mac OS X.
    We're making use of Apache Web Server, mod_perl and PostgreSQL. 
    The system is being mainly developed in Perl and partially in C.
    Several Perl libraries and a few C libraries are required.
    
    These dependencies are detailed in Section III of the SBDD.




Building and deploying OME

    OME is built from scratch with a few standard make commands.
    In the current deployment configuration, OME is running within 
    mod_perl. This process is created by the Apache httpd process in 
    order to take care of execution of HTTP requests that are handled 
    by Perl scripts via CGI. Apache and mod_perl are configured so that 
    they have access to the OME Perl scripts and modules. Apache is also 
    made aware of some HTML static pages and JavaScript libraries that 
    are needed to support dynamic content provided through mod_perl.
    
    Please refer to Section IV of the SBDD for detailed build and 
    deployment instructions.
