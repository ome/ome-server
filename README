Introduction

    This README file shortly sums up the contents of the Software Build
    and Deployment Document (SBDD) that is located in the OME/doc/SBDD 
    directory. 

    The SBDD describes how to build and deploy the Open Microscopy 
    Environment (OME) software. 

    All the information that is necessary and strictly related to the 
    build and deployment process is unfolded: a description of the 
    project repository and its organization, directions on how to 
    retrieve the files needed for a given build as well as how to 
    retrieve the latest developed source code, a list of constraints 
    that your system must satisfy if you want to build and deploy OME, 
    and, of course, detailed build and deployment instructions.




Dependencies

    The system is being developed and tested on Linux and Mac OS X.
    We're making use of Apache Web Server, mod_perl and PostgreSQL. 
    The system is being mainly developed in Perl and partially in C.
    Several Perl libraries and a few C libraries are required.
    
    These dependencies are detailed in Section III of the SBDD.




Building and deploying OME

    OME is built from scratch with a few standard make commands.
    In the current deployment configuration, OME is running within 
    mod_perl. This process is created by the Apache httpd process in 
    order to take care of execution of HTTP requests that are handled 
    by Perl scripts via CGI. Apache and mod_perl are configured so that 
    they have access to the OME Perl scripts and modules. Apache is also 
    made aware of some HTML static pages and JavaScript libraries that 
    are needed to support dynamic content provided through mod_perl.
    
    Please refer to Section IV of the SBDD for detailed build and 
    deployment instructions.
