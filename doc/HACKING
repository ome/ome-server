    OME is distributed with the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). You
    should be aware that any code submitted to the OME project will also fall
    under this license. If you have issues relating to licensing, want to sub
    license parts of the OME source code, or wish to discuss the licensing
    scheme please contact the OME core developers (ome-devel@mit.edu).

COPYRIGHT

    The OME source code, specification, documentation and database schema are,
    in their entirety Copyright (C) 2003 Open Microscopy Environment,
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology, National Institutes of Health,
    University of Dundee. As with the OME license, any questions related to the
    copyright, copyright holders or copyright scheme should be directed to the
    OME core developers (ome-devel@mit.edu).

DEVELOPER LOCATIONS

    The OME core developers are split between three main locations: OME Boston
    (MIT and Harvard; managed by Peter Sorger and Erik Brauner), OME Dundee
    (University of Dundee; managed by Jason Swedlow) and OME Baltimore (NIH;
    managed by Ilya Goldberg).

RESOURCES

    Most of the OME developer related documentation is either in the source tree
    (/doc and pod in the source files) or located on the CVS webserver
    (http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/). 

CVS AND THE SOURCE TREE

    A web based window into the source tree is located on the cvs webserver
    (http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/cvsweb/). CVS access and administration is
    performed by Chris Allan (callan@blackcat.ca), and all CVS modifications are
    done over SSH using CVS' ext protocol. You would checkout the CVS source
    using the following CVSROOT:
    
    CVS_RSH=ssh
    CVSROOT=:ext:username@cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk:/homes/cvs/ome
    cvs co ome

    Public/private key authentication using rsa or dsa SSH identities is
    preferred, but only over SSHv2. More information about how to create ssh
    keypairs can be found in the ssh-keygen documentation (man ssh-keygen).
    Information on how ~/.ssh/authorized_keys files work with SSH public/private
    keypairs can be found in the ssh documentation (man ssh). The OpenSSH
    project (http://www.openssh.org/) is also a source of all of this
    information provided you're unable to use the manpages.
    
    Any questions, suggestions or complaints about the CVS repository or the
    CVS/Develolper webserver should be directed to Chris.

SOURCE FILE STUBS

    Located below are example Perl and C stubs for source file submissions to
    the OME project. Notice that you may not specify an author clause within
    the copyright or license statement. However, you may use a separated
    "Written by" statement, as in the following templates.
