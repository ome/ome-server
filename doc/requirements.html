<h2>This serves as a starting point for the OME install guide.</h2>
<h4>I would GREATLY appreciate any comments, extra problems, etc.</h4>

<h3>
OS Requirements:</h3>
There is no requirement for any kind of UNIX per se - only certain open-source
libraries, perl modules, packages, and a unix-like file-system.
<br>
To my knowledge, there is no single UNIX distribution that has all
of these, but I may be wrong.<br>
OME is known to run on many Linux distros, and Mac OS X (which is my development platform) - as long as the following dependencies are met.
<h3>
Major package requirements:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a> >= 5.6</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>+mod_perl >= 1.3.12</li>
<li><a href="http://www3.us.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> >= 7.1 with ODBC
support (JDBC, Tcl/Tk optional but recommended)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick+PerlMagick</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>
Other Perl modules:</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Storable</li>
<li>
Apache::Session::File</li>

<li>
Image::Magick (PerlMagick)</li>

<li>
Frontier::XMLRPC (patched version <a href="packages/perl/Frontier-RPC-0.06.tar.gz">here</a>).</li>

<li>
DBI (problems with 1.20. RH 7.1 ships with 1.14 which is too old - use the one <a href="packages/perl/DBI-1.19.tar.gz">here</a>)</li>
<li>
DBD::Pg (problems with many versions - use the one <a href="packages/perl/DBD-Pg-0.95.tar.gz">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><br>All of the perl dependencies can be downloaded and installed with the following commands (as root):
<pre>> cd OME/src/perl/
> ./perlCheck.pl</pre>
Note that you should execute this script from the directory into which you installed the OME perl scripts - the directory from which they will
be served by Apache.  See the <a href="install.html">install</a> document.
N.B.:  This will <B>not</B> install postgres, Apache or mod_perl
<h4>
Other Libraries:</h4>
Usually need to re-install libtiff if you want LZW support.&nbsp; Get and
install the following libraries:
<br><a href="packages/source/tiff-v3.5.6-beta.tar.gz">tiff-v3.5.6-beta</a>
<br><a href="packages/source/libtiff-lzw-compression-kit-1.2.tar.gz">libtiff-lzw-compression-kit</a>
<h4>
ImageMagick</h4>
To be useful, ImageMagick (and PerlMagick) need the following additional
libraries, which are usually installed:
<br>jpeg-6b
<br>in the near future, also freetype-2.0.4 (this is latest version, can
probably use an earlier one)
<br>
Installing required libraries on Mac OS X is greatly simplified with the use of Christoph Pfisterer's <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a>.
<br>The perlCheck.pl script will install ImageMagick if it is missing, but it will <b>not</b> install these additional libraries.
<h4>
PostgreSQL:</h4>
You can find out what version you have (if any) by typing:<pre>> psql -V</pre>
It is best to compile PostgreSQL from its <a href="packages/source/postgresql-7.1.3.tar.gz">source</a> - I have had stability
problems with the binary RPMs. This may no longer be true with 7.1.3 - try binaries first if you want, then compile from source if they are unstable.  
PostgreSQL should be able to run for months with no problems.
To compile PostgreSQL, you will need the
following libraries (not strictly required, but highly recommended):
<br><a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html">readline</a>
(from gnu.org - usually present on Linux distros, but not always)
<br><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">ant</a> (from the jakarta
project - binary install or <a href="packages/RedHat/ant-1.4-2.noarch.rpm">RPM</a> is fine)
<p>run the configure script with something like the following command:
.
<pre>./configure --with-perl --with-tcl --enable-odbc --with-java</pre>
You may also want to set the data directory using with the flag --datadir=DIRECTORY.
Read the INSTALL document before doing anything. If you installed DBD::Pg
before doing this, you must install it again (do a 'make clean' first!)
so that it is linked against the proper Postgres libraries.
