Some useful literature describing OME:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="OMEWhitePaper.pdf">The original whitepaper</a> (pdf) written by Ilya Goldberg 
(<a href="mailto:igg@mit.edu">igg@mit.edu</a>) and Peter Sorger 
(<a href="mailto:psorger@MIT.EDU">psorger@MIT.EDU</a>).</a><br>
This whitepaper describes a CORBA distributed computing implementation.&nbsp;
The actual current implementation is to use a RDBMS for shared memory, with
connectors in xmlrpc (also ODBC, JDBC and Perl DBI).&nbsp; This whitepapaer
is useful however as a big-picture description of our project.</li>

<li>
<a href="ICCBtalk.pdf">A Presentation</a> (pdf) by Ilya Goldberg.<br>
This presentation is not as out of date as the whitepaper, but is lacking in supporting text.&nbsp;
It does have diagrams of the RDMS schema (in UML), and screenshots!</li>

<li>
<a href="OMEWhitePaper-JS.pdf">A subsequent whitepaper</a> by Jason Swedlow 
(<a href="mailto:j.swedlow@dundee.ac.uk">j.swedlow@dundee.ac.uk</a>).<br>
Much of the missing narrative to go with the above presentation.</li>

<li>
<a href="LRIG-Talk.pdf">Another Presentation</a> (pdf) by Ilya Goldberg.<br>
This presentation was given at the Lab Robotics Interest Group (<a href="http://lab-robotics.org/">LRIG</a>)
on May 23, 2001.&nbsp;
It has a simplified conceptual diagram of the data model,
along with examples of how the API works.  Screenshots of integration with
<a href="http://www.spotfire.com">Spotfire</a>, and web-interface
(<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniWeb</a>).</li>

</ul>

<h3>Software:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="OME-1.2-IR4.tar.gz">OME-1.2-IR4.tar.gz</a>&nbsp;  Download the source!  This is the fourth internal release.<br>
This release's new features are the perl dependency installer, and many bug fixes.  The next release will have several new features
which are discussed on the developer list (see below).<br>
First, look at the <a href="requirements.html">package dependencies</a> to make sure you have everything you need.<br>
Then, look at the <a href="install.html">install document</a> for additional installation help.

<li>
<a href="OMExmlrpc.html">xmlrpc documentation</a>.&nbsp; This is not 
complete, and lacks examples for C, Java, etc.</li>

<li>
<a href="ome.dtd">XML DTD</a> for the OME dataset, and a jpeg <a href="ome.dtd.diag-screen.jpg">diagram</a>
of same, and a <a href="ome.dtd.diag.pdf">pdf.</a></li>

OME is an open source project, with all of the code above licensed under GPL.<br>
Since a database is used to handle inter-module communication, we encourage (and in fact are working with) manufacturers to develop
commercial modules for acquisition, analysis, segmentation, etc that are compatible with OME.<br>
In addition, we are seeking developers to help
expand the capabilities of this system.  If you feel you can contribute to the code or documentation, please contact Ilya Goldberg (<a href="mailto:igg@mit.edu">igg@mit.edu</a>)
