Open Microscopy Environment - Install Notes (RedHat)
----------------------------------------------------

*NOTE* Obviously your favourite RedHat ftp mirror would be prefered

	http://www.redhat.com/download/mirror.html
	http://fedora.redhat.com/download/mirrors.html

*NOTE* This is a platform specific addendum to the main set of install notes
(INSTALL), please refer to that first.

________
Preamble

This addendum is based on package names from RedHat 8, if you're running a
different release most if not all of the package names will be the similar but
will *not* be the same. You *will* need to search for some on the release servers.

It is recommended that you use RedHat's package manager to install the core
packages and libraries that OME requires. It is also recommended that you
install using the latest packages from RedHat's updates tree and/or the latest
Fedora pacakges.
