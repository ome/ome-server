This directory contains patches and support files necessary for
modifying a "stock" OME installation to provide support for viewing
annotated images in a tabular format. 

The files provide a turn-key example installation using image files in the
ES_Bank directory.  The image files are screenshots of text listing the
correct annotations for each image.  The image files are arranged in a directory
structure that represents how they should be annotated, but this directory
structure is not parsed directly by the annotator, and the parsing code is not
included as this would varry greatly depending on the particular work-flow used
to collect the images.  What is included is a tab-delimited text file of the
correct annotations for each image.  The parser for this file is also included in the
distribution as it serves a useful example of a fairly sophisticated automated custom
annotator.

To quickly see an example of this working, take the following 5 steps:
  ome admin users add -u thomasmp
    This user will own the images and annotations.  Instead, you can replace thomasmp
    with your username in ES_Bank_images.txt (be careful with the tabs, line endings, etc!)
  perl dgas-templates.pl
    This installs the templates
  ome import ../../src/xml/OME/Annotations/DGASannotations.ome
    This imports the semantic types for genes, probes, etc.
  perl parseDGASannotations.pl DGAS_annotations.txt
    This imports images in ./DGAS_Images/, and annotates them using DGAS_annotations.txt
  visit http://localhost/perl2/serve.pl?Page=OME::Web::TableBrowse&Template=GeneManipulationTable
  
  Try playing with the rows/columns menus to see the layout possibilities.
  Restrict the display by typing in specific Genes separated by commas.
  Modify parseES-BankAnnotations.pl to link Genes to your favorite genomic database.
  Modify your favorite genomic database to link to image data in OME (all parameters
    can be specified in the URL)
  

The main components of this functionality include:

    1) The use of ImageAnnotationTable.pm to display annotated images
    in a 2d grid. 
    2) GeneStageAnnotator and ImageDetailAnnotator as modules for
    creating annotations.
    3) ImageAnnotationDetail for showing specific information about
    each image.

Each of these tools is driven by a set of data types as given in
src/xml/OME/Annotations/DGASannotations.ome.

Details of the implementation, configuration, and use of these tools can be
found  on the OME Wiki:
http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=NIA+Annotation+and+Viewing+Tools


There are several files in this directory that can be used to modify an
installation to provide this functionality:

   1) dgas-templates.pl installs the appropriate view and browse templates
      in the database:
      Browse/GeneProbeTable.tmpl, Browse/GeneManipulationTable.tmpl
      Display/One/OME/Image/GeneProbeTable.tmpl, Display/One/OME/Image/GeneManipulationTable.tmpl,
      /Actions/Annotator/ProbeStage.tmpl
   2) parseDGASannotations.pl is a perl script that reads annotations
      from the tab-delimited DGAS_annotations.txt file, and imports images
      from the DGAS_Images directory.
   3) wish.xls contains image annotations for the WISH project in a spreadsheet form.
      This spreadsheet is parsed by parseWISHannotations.pl, which is a slightly older
      example than parseDGASannotations.pl (use parseDGASannotations.pl for future work).
   4) Several display customizations are done using files in the ../NIA/ directory


Customizations of this functionality should begin with the
definition of a data model. This model should be instantiated in an
OME-XML file which would take the place of
DGASannotations.ome. A corresponding annotation spreadsheet,
containing instances of types from the newly-defined data model, must
also be built. Appropriate images should be obviously be provided as well.

There are three  types of functionality that are not covered by the
script and annotation files in this directory: category groups,
publications, and a home page for guest users.

The tabular image display supports color-coding images based on their
categorization within a specified category group. The stock OME
facility includes definition of the CategoryGroup and Category
semantic types, but the patches given here do not instantiate any
category groups or categories, so no annotations are given. These 
objects can be imported, or created through the web page. Individual
images can be categorized with the web interface, but creation of a
new AnnotationTeplate referring to appropriate category groups might
be needed. 

The other functionality that is not supported by these patches
involves publications. The ImageAnnotationDetail display has the
ability to display publications associated with an image via the
Publication and ImagePublication types defined in
DGASannotations.ome. If this data is added into the system (again,
via import or other means), it will be displayed as appropriate on
image detail pages.

Guest users do not have a default home page, so an appropriate entry point should be constructed
if these pages are to be made available to guest users.
Note that the parseDGASannotations.pl script retains user and group ownership for image annotations.
In order for guests to have access to this data, the group ownership must be set to "undefined" for
the Images, and the IImage MEXes that create the image Semantic Types
(typically, ImageProbe, ImageExperiment, etc.).  There are commented-out lines in the
parseDGASannotations.pl script that show how to do this.
