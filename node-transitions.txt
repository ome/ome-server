Node FSM

1. Waiting for dataset inputs
2. Waiting for image inputs (i.e., all images)
3. Waiting for feature inputs (i.e., all features)
4. Done


- Initialize each node (ie, load the program)
- Repeat until fixed point:
  - For each node:
    - If in stage 1, 2, or 3, and inputs are available, advance to
      next stage, retrieving any outputs generated.
- If every node is in stage 4, the analysis succeeded.  Otherwise,
  some data dependency error occurred (e.g., badly connected graph,
  modules didn't generate the outputs they promised).
