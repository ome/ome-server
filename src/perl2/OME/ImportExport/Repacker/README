Repacker version 0.01
=====================

This is the Repacker module.
The Repack routine takes in an arbitrary Perl string (vector) of
values with a particular endian-ness and # bytes/value, and
replaces the input string (in place) with a vector of the same 
values in the specified output endian-ness.

This is identical to performing a perl "unpack($infmt, $str)"
followed by a perl "pack($outfmt, $str)". However, it is
much faster.

Returns the number of values (not bytes) in the vector, or 0 if
an internal malloc() failed or if #bytes/value was not 1, 2,or 4.
