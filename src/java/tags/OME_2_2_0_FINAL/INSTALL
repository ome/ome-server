OME Java Library, Installation instructions
===========================================

If you have downloaded a pre-compiled copy of this library,
installation is as simple as placing all of the contained JAR files
into your classpath.  The ome-java.jar file contains appropriate
manifest information to encode its dependencies on the remaining
JAR's.

If you have downloaded a source version of the library, you must
compile the code into a JAR before using it.  This requires the Apache
Ant tool (available at http://ant.apache.org/).  Ant is a Java-based
"make" equivalent, and is very easy to install.

Once Ant is installed, the following commands can be run from the base
OME Java directory:


   ant

   Compiles all of the .java files in the /src directory into the
   /build directory.  There must be a valid "javac" compiler in your
   path for this to work.  (For advanced Ant users, you can use the
   standard command-line options to change certain aspects of the
   compilation process, such as the specific compiler used.)


   ant jar

   Assembles all of the compiled .class files into a JAR file.  Copies
   this file, plus all of its dependent libraries, into the /jar
   directory.  If the .java files have not been compiled yet, they are
   compiled just as if you ran the previous command.


   ant apidocs

   Creates your own local copy of the library's Javadoc documentation
   and places it in the /docs/api directory.  This directory can then
   be moved to a web server content directory, or viewed in a browser
   directly from the filesystem.
