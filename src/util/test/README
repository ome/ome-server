These scripts perform tests of the OME system
The scripts use the Expect perl module to exercise parts of OME
acessible by the command line. 

ome-smoke-test.sh
  Example:
    sudo ./ome-smoke-test.sh igg ~igg/OME/OME ~igg/OME/OME-WEBSITE/TestImages 3\
    "--to=igg@helix.nih.gov" "/Users/igg/OME/OME/src/util/misc/SMTPclient.pl \
    --stdin --from=igg@nih.gov --host=helix.nih.gov --subject="

  This script uses the install.pl and import.pl scripts to install a fresh DB
  and import a directory full of images into it.  It relies on an existing
  install environment in /etc/ome-install.store.  The following changes will be
  made for testing purposes:
    $e->{DB_conf}->{Name}=$TEST_DB
    $e->{admin_user}=$OME_ADMIN
    $e->{ome_user}->{OMEName}=$OME_ADMIN
  This script requires the following parameters to run:
  OME_ADMIN SOURCE_DIR IMAGE_DIR EXPECT_IMAGES [MAIL_TO] [MAIL_PROGRAM]
  OME_ADMIN:
    This is a unix user, postgres user and ome experimenter, commonly known as
    the ome admin user.  This username will be used (with "su -") to run the ome
    import command, postgres commands (dropdb, etc), and cvs update on the
    SOURCE_DIR and IMAGE_DIR directories.
    The install environment will be modified to set this username for
    the admin user and the username (OMEName) of the ome experimenter.
  SOURCE_DIR:
    A cvs update will be run in this directory, then the install.pl inside it.
  IMAGE_DIR:
    A cvs update will be run in this directory, and the files inside it sent to
    "ome import"
  EXPECT_IMAGES:
    The number of images in the $IMAGE_DIR
  MAIL_TO and MAIL_PROGRAM
    If MAIL_TO is set, email will be sent with the following command using a pipe
    or input redirection:
      $MAIL_PROGRAM"some subject" $MAIL_TO
    For UNIX mail (default)
      MAIL_PROGRAM="mail -s"
      MAIL_TO="someuser@somehost.com"
    For SMTPclient (in src/util/misc)
      MAIL_PROGRAM="$SOURCE_DIR/src/util/misc/SMTPclient.pl --stdin --from=igg@nih.gov --host=helix.nih.gov --subject="
      MAIL_TO='--to=ome-nitpick@lists.openmicroscopy.org.uk'
    For no mail, do not specify either parameter


install.pl
  Performs an install of a fresh DB.  It uses settings already present in
  /etc/ome-install.store and uses Expect to set the password for the initial user
  The initial experimenter should already be set in /etc/ome-install.env.
  This will will *not* be set to the OME_ADMIN parameter to ome-smoke-test.sh.
  The user and password are sent as parameters, but currently only the
  password is used.

import.pl
  Import files provided as the arguments using the 'ome import' command.  Logs in
  to the DB using the supplied user and password arguments

Required perl modules:
  Expect
  IO::Tty

These scripts also send mail in one of three ways - regular unix mail, or using
a script to drive Mail.app in OS X or as an SMTP client using the supplied script
SMPTPclient.pl.  SMTPclient.pl allows you to specify authentication parameters
in order to send mail by talking to an SMTP server directly.

SMTPclient.pl requires the following perl modules:
  Net::SSLeay      Net_SSLeay.pm-1.25
  IO::Socket::SSL  IO-Socket-SSL-0.96
  Digest           Digest-1.08
  Digest::SHA1     Digest-SHA1-2.10
  Digest::HMAC     Digest-HMAC-1.01
