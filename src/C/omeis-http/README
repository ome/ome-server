Compile the libhttpOMEIS library:
./autogen.sh
make

Compile the main.c file (test creation/deletion API) do:
gcc -L. main.c -lcurl -lhttpOMEIS
Compile the testStats file to test retreival of plane and stack statistics
gcc -L. -o testStats testStats.c -lcurl -lhttpOMEIS

Note that the configure script is maintained on CVS.  This means that if you change
any of the dependencies, you should run autogen.sh to make a new configure script
as usual, but then you should commit the new configure script to CVS!
