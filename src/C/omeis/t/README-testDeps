OMEIS should be empty (no files in Files or Pixels beginning with a number)

upload 3 files
make 1 pixels from the three files
upload the three files again under different names (making aliases)
three originals should have one alias and one pixel dep

delete the three originals
the three alias files should now be originals (isAlias is false) with one pixel dep

purge the pixels
the pixels should be identical (GetPixels and compare SHA1).

delete alias #1
the remaining two should have no pixel deps

purging the pixels should report 0 pixels purged

the pixels should be identical (GetPixels and compare SHA1).

make 1 pixels (#2) from the remaining 2 file aliases
the two aliases should have a new pixels dep to #2

make 1 pixels (#3) from alias #3
the last alias should have two pixel deps (#2 and #3)

purge pixels #2 and #3
read pixels #2 and #3 - check sha1s
purge pixels #2 and #3

delete the #2 pixels
alias #3 should have a pixel dep to Pixels #1
alias #2 should have no pixel deps

delete the remaining two aliases (no error)
read pixels #2 and #3 - check sha1s

delete the remaining pixels (no error)
