These directories and files connect omeis to Paul Heckbert's zoom. http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph

This code comes from several places.  Primarily it is based on Paul Heckbert's zoom and Rich's extensions to it.  There's a bit of spackle to make it callable by omeis with Pixels as an input stream.

The tiff, jpeg, and png implementations have open_stream() methods.  The tiff "streaming" is accomplished by using code from libtiff/contrib/mfs (Mike Johnson) to support tiff i/o operations to ram, which gets sent to the stream when the tiff is closed.

There seems to be some potential here to implement some pipelined DSP, which might be pretty cool.
