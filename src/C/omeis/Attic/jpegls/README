JPEG-LS is the new lossless/near-lossless compression standard for continuous-tone images, 
ISO-14495-1/ITU-T.87. The standard is based on the LOCO-I algorithm (LOw COmplexity LOssless
COmpression for Images) developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories.

These directories and files contain Ismaeil R. Isameil's JPEG-LS implementation at the 
University of British Columbia, modified to be compilable and usable within OMEIS.

We use JPEG-LS in OMEIS because it is the best loss-less compression algorithm 
available (both for absolute compression and time efficiency).
