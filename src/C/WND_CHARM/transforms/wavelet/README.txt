This wavelet compression code is based on "wavecomp", a wavelet compression library
written by:
Chris Fleizach cfleizac@cs.ucsd.edu June 4th, 2006
Currently there are no distribution terms, and we have contacted the author to clarify.
wavecmp.cpp is the main entry point.

The code distributed with wavecomp includes code from other distributions:
convolution.cpp is Copyright (c) 2006 Filip Wasilewski <filipwasilewski@gmail.com>
convolution.h is Copyright (c) 2006 Filip Wasilewski <filipwasilewski@gmail.com>
wt.h is Copyright (c) 2006 Filip Wasilewski <filipwasilewski@gmail.com>
These are distributed with a liberal, license-propagating terms believed to be compatible with
the GNU GPL.

Filter.h is Copyright 1996 Geoff Davis 9/11/96
These distribution terms are restricted to use for "research purposes".
The files that include Filter.h bear no mention of this copyright or any other, but
they don't appear to do anything "interesting" other than initialization functions.
We will investigate eliminating the need for these files.
