/**
 * A DataTransfer Flavor for {@link Module} objects. This one encodes the 
 * module id as a string, rather than as an Integer. It's a bit of a hack,
 * but it seems necessary if we're going to allow drag/drop of both chains and
 * modules based on a single id - they must have separate class names in the 
 * {@link DataFlavor}, and using {@link Integer} and {@link String} is easier 
 * than serializing either {@link Chain} or {@link Module}
 * (any class used in a Flavor must support serialization...).
