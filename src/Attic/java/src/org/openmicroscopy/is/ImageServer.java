/**
 * <p>Defines methods for interacting with an OME image server.  There
 * are currently two ways to connect to an image server:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li><b>HTTP</b> - This is the usual connection mechanism.  All
 * calls to the image server are sent via HTTP.  The details of the
 * method to be called are sent as URL parameters.  The result of the
 * method called is parsed out of the HTTP response.</li>
 *
 * <li><b>CLI</b> - If the image server is on the same machine as the
 * client code (the code using this interface), it is possible to
 * execute the image server directly as a command-line program.  This
 * gives a slight performance increase over the HTTP interface.
 * However, in most production environments, the client code and image
 * server reside on separate machines, rendering this connection
 * mechanism unusable.</li>
